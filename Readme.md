# Horizon As a central queue manager

Imagine that we have several microservices and one Redis server to handle queues, in this case, we can use Laravel Horizon as the central queue manager for all of the queues of all microservices.
BUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE! Because Laravel created a premium application called Nova for this use! 

# There is another way to do that!
We can use Prometheus and Grafana!
